                                                          Crop Analysis - Machine Learning
**Overview**

The Crop Machine Learning project focuses on predicting the suitable crop for cultivation based on various soil and environmental factors. The input features include the nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) content ratios in the soil, along with temperature, humidity, pH value, and rainfall. The goal is to determine the optimal crop for cultivation by employing machine learning models.

**N** - ratio of nitrogen content in soil.

**P** - ratio of phosphorous content in soil.

**K** - ratio of Potassium content in soil.

**Humidity** - Relative humidity in %.

**ph** - ph value of soil.

**Temperature**- (Celsius)

**Rainfall**- (mm)

                                                                  Conclusion

The implemented models, including **Naive Bayes** and **RandomForest**, exhibit good accuracy in predicting crop recommendations. Users can input specific soil and environmental parameters, such as nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, and the system predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation.

With these models at the forefront, users gain reliable predictions for crop selection based on soil and environmental conditions. This empowers farmers and agricultural practitioners to make well-informed decisions, fostering efficiency and productivity in farming practices. The project's outcomes position it as a valuable tool for optimizing crop choices, aligning with the broader goal of enhancing agricultural sustainability and success.
